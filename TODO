IDEAS:
 A speed system including haste
  (to make things work smoothly player speed should be constant, some kind of monster_speed/player_speed)
 Two-weapon fighting
  (add some dnd-esque minus to ab)
 More weapons (esp. heavy)
 Add potions/random items to level
 Add random starting items
 Add 's'neak
 Add some way to give +STR/DEX/CON/MAG
 Make it possible to walk long distances
 Make a '?'
 Add some way to document and learn spells
 Fix some nice spell visual effect
 Re-add throw function
 Add items to monsters
 Add monster shout (make people nearby notice player)
 Add a 'you're standing on...'
 New class(es)!
  cleric?

SPELLS:
-Level 1
  Shield

BUGS:
 Dropped items do not show up (no sprite)
 Monsters take 2 turns when player casting spells

IMPROVE:
 FOV-recompute is not impressive: 
  +0.8 'magic number'
  many tiles are checked over and over again
 Def xrender_smap runs the 'for object in objects' over and over again
 Def Graveyard should be remade a bit..
  make it more fancy looking
  make it work better for more corpses
  ?add an autoremove for those outside the list
 Add some kind of 'disrupt' for spellcasting, i.e. when they take damage while casting
 No level cap to spell('magic missile'), should be capped at lvl9
 MAYBE make monsters stop cheating when looking for player
 MAYBE make monsters stop cheating when casting spells
